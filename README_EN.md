# Snowdog Academy

## Stage 1

### Introduction

#### Welcome

Congratulations! You made it to the first stage of Snowdog Academy. There are 8 tasks waiting for you that will help you get familiar with the basic capabilities and principles of Magento.

#### Get ready

We assume that you have some knowledge from the IT field (programming, databases etc.). Skills from PHP, JS, HTML will be useful. We suggest that you take a look at the contents of the websites linked below as they may be helpful while developing the solutions to the tasks.

To run the application, you need to obtain authentication keys that are used to download Composer packages from Magento servers. Instruction on how to get them is [here](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html).

#### Environment

Specifically for the academy, we prepared a Docker environment. Instructions on how to run it are available [here](./.docker/README_EN.md).

#### Resources

#### Story

You will be a part of a Wihajster project. You will be responsible for improving the store running on Magento 2 platform. The store is specialized in selling wihajsters and accessories to them. The most recent request is an implementation of an SMS subscription system. Registered customers should be able to sign in to an SMS newsletter and receive the news from the wihajsters world on their phones.

#### Rules

You will work on a fork of this repository. Each task should be developed on a separate branch which will be named appropriately (eg. `branch-1` or `task-1`). When you complete the task, you'll send us a link to a pull request, and we will make a code review for you. The changes will be merged to the main branch after the code review process is complete.
